# crackingcaptchas
612 Project

Goal of the project is to use deep learning to crack simple alphanumeric CAPTCHAs.

There are two main approaches here. The first uses a per digit approach, which splits generated CAPTCHAs into individual digits and classifies them. The second approach processes entire CAPTCHAs as an input and attempts to classify them that way.

We found the first approach to be much more accurate and reliable than the second.
